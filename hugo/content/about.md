{{< figure class="image main" src="/images/pic03.jpg" >}}
I'm a 20 self taught Software Engineer, currently living in lagos, nigeria. I dropped out of the Federal University Of Technology, Akure where i was studying Remote GIS.

I write javascript (mostly) and rust and i enjoy working on front end code with react + mobx as well as back end with nodejs and rust (I'm more partial to rust these days).
I'm a linux nerd, i write bash and i've been using ubuntu exclusively for the past 3 years for all my coding work. I enjoy listening to alternative-rock, rock, a little rap, edm, house, pop and R&B (Basically whatever sounds good, i looooooove music and i'm an audiophile). 

I'm into philosophy, and i consider myself an enthusiast of maths and classical physics. You'll mostly find me scouring the internet acquiring knowledge.
